18631,"BadgerSmith points ago Some Calgary guy potentially compromising National and international pedophile investigations. Anyone who is repeatedly doing this stuff in public is already known to police. Criminal investigators are trained to gather usable evidence that stands up in court: There are good reasons why strong cases take years to carefully build, and why actions are guided by legal strategy: If pedophiles could be effectively addressed through entrapment alone; we would have eliminated pedophiles by now: Now that this person is outed, be prepared for their network to seal shut temporarily and relocate, with accompanying destruction of evidence; and forcing LEOs hand to act now when it may not be ready: The person ought to file a police report now so that police can provide guidance about how to best salvage the case  or to add to an ongoing investigation in the off chance that the perp is new to the system: That would be the best outcome for past and future victims, at the expense of Internet hero points. day"

19599,"NEWS RELEASE Calgary Transit Embraces Questionable Tactics Against Christian Employee After of working for Calgary Transit, Jesse Rau_ City Transit employee with previously spotless employment record_ has suddenly faced pressure and false accusations after speaking out against the new sacred cow_ the pride bus Recently Rau came out publicly in the media indicating that he was concerned that his job could be on the line if he refused to drive the bus that promotes behavior and lifestyles that the Bible calls sinful. Christian believe in the Bible as being the Word of God and It teaches that sexual immorality is sin_ don want to have any part in promoting behaviors and lifestyles that eople more trouble with God than they already are, and that create more brokenness and despair in their lives_ stated Rau Within the last month Rau has suddenly had warning from the powers that be at the City Transit indicating that he'd better be silent about his beliefs and make no more trouble in the media If he wanted to keep his job, Also after making his public statements In the media about the pride bus suddenly ""clock in the morning_ Rau gets called into the office and receives complaint wrongfully asserting that he was texting whlle driving public transit bus Jesse Rau had this to say about such claim_ ""Iam very careful not to text while driving aware that public transit is blessing t0 many and always want to keep the people on my bus safe and secure_ as much as have to say about it. It seems like am being targeted for speaking out for my faith In the one warning Jesse was given it was revealed that Calgary Transit had been monitoring hls persona Facebook posts and Iet him know that if he wanted future prospects with Calgary Transit, he had best stop posting his views Facebook: submitting t0 their pressure_ Rau immediately stopped using Facebook altogether wanting to be sure not to jeopardize his job feel like people at Calgary Transit are now against me because stand firmly for my Christian faith and won't compromise my values even though much of society seems to said Rau. The Calgary Transit has gone too far With this issue and the City of Calgary needs to ensure that the civil rights of Christians are protected against those that put ocial engineering bove Charter guaranteed and protected freedoms Calgarians should be outraged that their tax dollars are being used to abuse City Transit employees who deserve the freedoms they have been quaranteed by Iaw. Jesse Rau will host press conference tomorrow at 10.30 am in front of Calgary'$ Hall.

Will you agree to not play politics/political chess with Indigenous rights finally?
